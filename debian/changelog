wv (1.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * QA upload.
  * New upstream release.
    - Version 1.2.3 fixes multiple integer overflows.  [CVE-2006-4513]
      Closes: #396256.
    - Version 1.2.4 fixes unfiltered input in wvHandleCommandField(), and
      potential segfaults in wvBeginDocument() and wvEndDocument().
      There's no CVE, and no mention of security implications, but this
      still might be worth backporting to stable.
    - SONAME changed to libwv-1.2-3, though there have been no changes to
      the ABI.  Dumbass upstream.

    Ensure that all man pages have a consistent set of references.

     warnings)

      It'll have to wait until libtool is fully integrated...
    * Not built with libmagick5-dev due to problems with configure
      detecting it (caused by <magick/config.h> redefining HasPNG)...
